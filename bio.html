<p>
My name is Neena. </br>
I was born and raised in Portland, OR, but I've now made Boston, MA my new home. I am currently an undergraduate student at Tufts University, studying international relations, computer science and Japanese. I am fascinated by that tricky area at the crossroads of technology and diplomacy, especially in the context of modern warfare. I like dolphins, whistling, and fuzzy blankets.

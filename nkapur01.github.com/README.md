Assignment one: Personal Portfolio

I have successfully implemented the following:
index.html--contains my name, an image, and links to my resume and bio
bio.html--contains a short bio, links to the home page and resume
resume.html--contains my resume, links to the home page and bio

I asked Will Clarkson for help in rendering my mobile stylesheet on a phone. I had difficulty implementing it at first.

I am still having a little difficulty formatting my mobile stylesheet. It opens and is very readable on a mobile device, but I could definitely improve my formatting.

I worked for 5-6  hours on this project.
